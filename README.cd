# Online Curriculum Project by Pere Calder√≥n u1987441

## Analysis of the Project
For any job opportunities, especially during the summer months, I am open to new collaborations and 
projects related to the fields of computer science and customer service. 
I aim to use vacation periods to further develop my skills in real professional settings, 
contributing to the growth of the company while enriching my own experience. If you need someone 
with programming knowledge, teamwork abilities, and a strong willingness to learn, please feel free to contact me.

## Information Architecture
The information is distributed in a structure divided into two main parts: a sidebar
and a main content area. The sidebar contains the most important personal information, such as the name,
contacts, knowledge in programming languages and spoken languages.
There is also a button to enable dark mode, improve accessibility and adapt to the user's visual preferences.
The main section includes a profile summary, academic and work experience, arranged chronologically to facilitate reading.
This structure allows the user to visualize the information in a logical and coherent way,
highlighting their experience and technical skills.

## Visual Design
The main design decisions are based on simplicity and clarity.
A neutral color palette is used to keep attention on information,
using a dark green tone in the sidebar and a light gray background in the body of the page.
The titles have a clear visual hierarchy, with green as the highlighted color for highlighting important sections.
Buttons and interactive elements, such as the dark mode button, include transitions to offer a smooth and enjoyable experience.
In addition, dark mode transforms the sidebar to black and background to dark gray, with white text, to improve
readability and adapt to environments with little light.
